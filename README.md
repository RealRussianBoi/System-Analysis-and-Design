# System-Analysis-and-Design

The DriverPass program was requested from my company by Liam.
He envisioned a driving program that contained online classes for students new to driving and the rules of the road which pulled regulations from the DMV website directly to ensure the most accurate and up-to-date information.
The feautures of this program started from choosing a package that would suit the customer and allow variative access to the program's online resources. 
Based on this package, the user would have access to online classes and special tests tied to what they just learned. Like mentioned earlier, the information would be pulled from the DMV website directly, refreshing its data each time the DMV released an update or change of rules. 
For more expensive packages, the user would be able to schedule in-person driving lessons. The length of these lessons would vary on the package purchased by the client. 

What I did particularly well in my job was outlining the business requirements, as well as identifying/creating the systems's design. I took the most active role in its creation, and the actual program was created based on my criteria. 

I think that there is little room for improvement in what I created as I used many proffessional resources and references to create a state-of-the-art design that was in sync with the modern demand of system analysis.

I interpreted the user's needs by re-reading their requirements several times and creating designs that would best fit what they envisioned, filtering those with the higher-ups before stopping at what I submitted in my GitHub commits.
It was important to consider and implement exactly what the user needed as they could become a returning customer, should they desire to implement something new in their program through the use of my company. 
Leaving a positive experience is what matters most, and can only be accomplished by satisfying their needs in the most practical and accurate way possible. 

I approached the creaion of my documents using proffessional resources and my own personal experience in system analysis and design. 
I used the knowledge that I gained in my university classes to the full extent, including information on how to create such documents, what criteria and key points should be included, as well as what strategies to use.
I will continue to use these strategies in the future projects I am assigned, coupled with my constantly growing experience in this sphere of software development.
